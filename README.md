**Weekend Homework: Vue Application with Requests**

Learning Objectives
- Be able to create a multi-component web application, with Vue
- Be able to make API requests to load JSON data into your application

# Brief
Your task is to create an application that makes a request to an API and displays the data.

**MVP**
- The application should display data from an API request.
- The application should have a clear separation of concerns (multiple components)
- Take input from the user to update the page. You could update the page by filtering or manipulating the data on user interaction, or you might make further API requests to load more data that is then displayed.

**Extensions**
Looking into a library to visual the data.

- Leaflet is an open-source library for rendering maps
- Google Charts is a library for rendering charts and graphs
- Canvas is a drawing surface for JavaScript.
- You will need to use the libraryâ€™s documentation to integrate it into your application.

**Planning**
- Look at the JSON you are going to be loading into your app and based on the data, draw a wireframe
- Start by loading the data from the API into your application and checking that it has loaded, before doing any work on the views
- Plan your components and draw a diagram of the data flow through the application
